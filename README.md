# fill-frontend-take-home-mehul
A take home frontend assessment


Avoided using React or any framework because:
- Wanted to keep the functionality lite
    -- I always strive to not use too many libraries, so that the application does not get bloated




Edge cases handled in the behavior of Drag and drop:
- If you drop a page to the extreme left or extreme right, it should become the first or the last page, respectively.
- If you drop on top of a page, depending on if it's 50% left or right, it will be dropped accordingly.


# SASS
sass sass/index.scss:index.css --watch





# TODO:

> "Expanded" state should only show on hover
> Drag and drop should not consider gaps
> Write test cases

> Adding pages should add them in the current sequence
> Deleting the page should delete it from the current sequence
